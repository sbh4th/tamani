## Basic setup for DD with variable timing
.right-column[
We have different districts that are exposed to our intervention at different times. We often use OLS (or LPM) to fit:
$$y_{it} = \alpha_{i} + \tau_{t} + \beta^{DD}{D_{it}} + \epsilon_{it}$$
### where
- $y_{it}$ is the outcome for unit $i$ at time $t$.
- $\alpha_{i}$ are unit-specific fixed effects.
- $\tau_{t}$ are fixed effects for each time period.
- $D_{it}$ is a time-varying treatment indicator.
- $\beta^{DD}$ is the difference-in-differences estimate.
]

---
# Key points from Goodman-Bacon (2019)
.right-column[
- ### With OLS, DD with treatment timing is a variance-weighted average of many 2x2 ATTs.
- ### Weights are a function of both group sizes *and* variances.
- ### Can lead to $\beta^{DD}$ that is a poor summary of group-specific effects.

## Callaway-Sant'Anna Approach: Group-Time cohorts
- The CS approach starts with defining Group-Time cohorts.
- Groups defined by when they were *first* treated.

```{r gt, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# create group-time aggregate data
d_agg <- d_sba %>% group_by(group, time) %>%
  summarise(tsba = sum(tsba),
         tpop = sum(tpop),
         psba = tsba / tpop, # % SBA
         txdel = mean(txdel))

gt <- d_agg %>% select(group, time, psba, tpop) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = time, names_prefix = "t",
              values_from = c(psba, tpop))

gt %>%
  kbl(digits=3, col.names = c("Group", "Time1", "Time2", "Time3", "Time4",
          "Time5", "Time1", "Time2", "Time3", "Time4", "Time5")) %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "P(SBA)" = 5, "Total Pop" = 5))

```

- Different aggregation schemes for ATTs are possible.
- Can allow for covariates via regressions adjustments, IPW and DR.
---
### Callawy-Sant'Anna implementation
.footnote[See https://bcallaway11.github.io/did/articles/multi-period-did.html for R, https://econpapers.repec.org/software/bocbocode/S458976.htm for Stata ]

- Includes options for different structure, SE calculation, weights, etc.

```{r csdid, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Use not-yet-treated as comparison group
did::att_gt(yname = "sba_birth", # name of the LHS variable
  tname = "time", # name of the time variable
  idname = "p_id", # name of the id variable
  gname = "group", # name of the first treatment period
  data = d_ind, # dataset
  xformla = NULL, # conditional parallel-trends
  weightsname = NULL, # can add weights
  est_method = "reg", # estimation method
  control_group = "notyettreated", # set the control group
  bstrap = TRUE, # compute bootstrapped SE
  biters = 1000, # bootstrap iterations
  print_details = FALSE, # if TRUE, print detailed results
  panel = FALSE, # panel or repeated cross-sectional
  clustervars = NULL) # cluster ID
```

---
## Estimates from CS approach
.left-column[
- Note there is no *overall* estimate, lots of heterogeneity.

- Each treatment group has an ATT at each time period.

- Can be combined to produce different aggregate ATTs.
]
.right-column[
```{r cs_est, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
atts_8 <- did::att_gt(yname = "sba_birth", tname = "time",

  footnote(general = "P-value for pre-test of parallel trends assumption:  0.31") %>%
  kable_styling()
```
]

---
### Re-creating the Group-Time ATTs
- ATT(.red[2],.blue[2]) means estimating ATT .blue[*at time 2*] for the group .red[*first treated at time 2*]

- For ATT(2,2) we are comparing Pr(SBA) between:
```{r gt22, echo=FALSE}
# drop pop estimates
gt <- d_agg %>% select(group, time, psba) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = time, names_prefix = "time",
              values_from = psba)
gt %>%
  kbl(digits=3, escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  column_spec(2:3, color = "black", background = "red") %>%
  row_spec(2:4, background  = "lightgray") %>%
  column_spec(4:6, background = "white") %>%
  column_spec(1, background = "white") %>%
  kable_minimal() %>%
  footnote(general = "Red = treated, Gray = untreated")
```

---
```{r gt22a, echo=FALSE}
# drop pop estimates
gt <- d_agg %>% select(group, time, psba) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = time, names_prefix = "time",
              values_from = psba)
gt %>%
  kbl(digits=3, escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  column_spec(2:3, color = "black", background = "red") %>%
  row_spec(2:4, background  = "lightgray") %>%
  column_spec(4:6, background = "white") %>%
  column_spec(1, background = "white") %>%
  kable_minimal() %>%
  footnote(general = "Red = treated, Gray = untreated")
```

- The 2x2 (weighted averages):
```{r att22, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
d_agg %>% filter(time < 3) %>%
  mutate(g22 = if_else(group==2,1,0)) %>%
  group_by(g22, time) %>%
  summarise(tsba = sum(tsba),
            tpop = sum(tpop),
            psba = tsba / tpop) %>%
  select(g22, time, psba) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = time, values_from = psba,
              names_prefix = "time") %>%
  mutate(`Long diff` = `time2` - `time1`) %>%
  group_by() %>%
  mutate(ATT_2_2 = `Long diff` - lag(`Long diff`, default = NA)) %>%
  kable(digits=3) %>%
  column_spec(5, bold=TRUE) %>%
  kable_minimal()
```

This estimate says that intervention increased the probability of an SBA birth by 0.01 for Group 2 at Time 2.

---

- For ATT(2,3) the groups being compared are:
```{r gt23, echo=FALSE}
# drop pop estimates
gt %>%
  kbl(digits=3, escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  column_spec(c(2,4), color = "black", background = "red") %>%
  row_spec(2, background = "white") %>%
  row_spec(3:4, background  = "lightgray") %>%
  column_spec(c(3,5,6), background = "white") %>%
  column_spec(1, background = "white") %>%
  kable_minimal() %>%
  footnote(general = "Red = treated, Gray = untreated")
```


- ATT(.red[2],.blue[3]) means estimating the ATT .blue[*at time 3*] for the group .red[*first treated at time 2*]

- Need to exclude any group treated at time 3 to avoid bias.

- The group first treated at time 3 is excluded.

- Provides an estimate of the lagged impact of intervention.

---
```{r gt23a, echo=FALSE}
# drop pop estimates
gt %>%
  kbl(digits=3, escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  column_spec(c(2,4), color = "black", background = "red") %>%
  row_spec(2, background = "white") %>%
  row_spec(3:4, background  = "lightgray") %>%
  column_spec(c(3,5,6), background = "white") %>%
  column_spec(1, background = "white") %>%
  kable_minimal() %>%
  footnote(general = "Red = treated, Gray = untreated")
```

- The 2x2 (weighted averages):
```{r att23, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
d_agg %>% filter((time==1 | time==3) & group!=3) %>%
  mutate(g23 = if_else(group==2,1,0)) %>%
  group_by(g23, time) %>%
  summarise(tsba = sum(tsba),
            tpop = sum(tpop),
            psba = tsba / tpop) %>%
  select(g23, time, psba) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = time, values_from = psba,
              names_prefix = "time") %>%
  mutate(`Long diff` = `time3` - `time1`) %>%
  group_by() %>%
  mutate(ATT_2_3 = `Long diff` - lag(`Long diff`, default = NA)) %>%
  kable(digits=3) %>%
  column_spec(5, bold=TRUE) %>%
  kable_minimal()
```

---
class: center, middle
# Etc., etc., etc...

---
- For ATT(4,2) the groups being compared are:
```{r gt42, echo=FALSE}
# drop pop estimates
gt %>%
  kbl(digits=3, escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  column_spec(c(2,3), color = "black", background = "red") %>%
  row_spec(1, background = "white") %>%
  row_spec(c(2,4), background = "lightgray") %>%
  column_spec(c(1,4,5,6), background = "white") %>%
  kable_minimal() %>%
  footnote(general = "Red = treated, Gray = untreated")
```


- ATT(.red[4],.blue[2]) means estimating the ATT .blue[*at time 2*] for the group .red[*first treated at time 4*]

- Need to exclude any group treated at time 2 to avoid bias.

- The group first treated at time 2 is excluded.

- Provides an estimate of the lead effects or non-parallel trends.

---
```{r gt42a, echo=FALSE}
# drop pop estimates
gt %>%
  kbl(digits=3, escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  column_spec(c(2,3), color = "black", background = "red") %>%
  row_spec(1, background = "white") %>%
  row_spec(c(2,4), background = "lightgray") %>%
  column_spec(c(1,4,5,6), background = "white") %>%
  kable_minimal() %>%
  footnote(general = "Red = treated, Gray = untreated")
```

- The 2x2 (weighted averages):
```{r att42, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
d_agg %>% filter(time < 3 & group >= 3) %>%
  mutate(g42 = if_else(group==4,1,0)) %>%
  group_by(g42, time) %>%
  summarise(tsba = sum(tsba),
            tpop = sum(tpop),
            psba = tsba / tpop) %>%
  select(g42, time, psba) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = time, values_from = psba,
              names_prefix = "time") %>%
  mutate(`Long diff` = `time2` - `time1`) %>%
  group_by() %>%
  mutate(ATT_4_2 = `Long diff` - lag(`Long diff`, default = NA)) %>%
  kable(digits=3) %>%
  column_spec(5, bold=TRUE) %>%
  kable_minimal()
```

---
Our 'hand-calculated' ATT(4,2) of -0.062 is the same as the regression-based CS estimate:
```{r cs_est_42, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
atts_8 <- did::att_gt(yname = "sba_birth", tname = "time", 
  idname = "p_id", gname = "group", data = d_ind, 
  xformla = NULL, weightsname = NULL, est_method = "reg",
  control_group = "notyettreated", bstrap = TRUE, 
  biters = 1000, print_details = FALSE, panel = FALSE,
  cband=FALSE)
cstable <- tidy(atts_8)
cstable %>% select(-point.conf.low, -point.conf.high) %>%
  kbl(digits=3, escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  row_spec(7, background = "yellow")
```

---
"Final" ATT(4,4) compares only 2 groups (4 clusters):
```{r gt44, echo=FALSE}
gt %>%
  kbl(digits=3, escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  column_spec(c(4,5), color = "black", background = "red") %>%
  row_spec(1:2, background = "white") %>%
  row_spec(4, background = "lightgray") %>%
  column_spec(c(1,2,3,6), background = "white") %>%
  kable_minimal() %>%
  footnote(general = "Red = treated, Gray = untreated")
```

- The 2x2 (weighted averages):
```{r att44, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
d_agg %>% filter((time ==3 | time == 4) & group >= 4) %>%
  mutate(g44 = if_else(group==4,1,0)) %>%
  group_by(g44, time) %>%
  summarise(tsba = sum(tsba),
            tpop = sum(tpop),
            psba = tsba / tpop) %>%
